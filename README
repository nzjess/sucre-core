Introduction
-------------

Sucre core provides the core set of Sucre modules.  It also includes common utilities that are depended on by other, separately distributed modules.
The core modules are generally those that have no non-core Java dependencies.  

Sucre core provides the following:

 - Reflect
    - Makes reflection a little more sugary for Java Bean-style classes.
    
 - Coercer
    - Give your simple types a gentle nudge this way or that when they need it.
     
 - Attributes
    - In the style of java.util.Properties, but a bit sweeter.  Combines Reflect and Coercer and adds a nice proxying layer.
